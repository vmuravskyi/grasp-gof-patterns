High cohesion is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused, manageable and
understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. High cohesion means that
the responsibilities of a given set of elements are strongly related and highly focused on a rather specific topic.
Breaking programs into classes and subsystems, if correctly done, is an example of activities that increase
the cohesive properties of named classes and subsystems. Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation in which
a set of elements, of e.g., a subsystem, has too many unrelated responsibilities. Subsystems with low cohesion
between their constituent elements often suffer from being hard to comprehend, reuse, maintain and change as a whole.
