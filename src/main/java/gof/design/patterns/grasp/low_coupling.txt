Low coupling
Main article: Loose coupling
Coupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements.
Low coupling is an evaluative pattern that dictates how to assign responsibilities for the following benefits:

lower dependency between the classes,
change in one class having a lower impact on other classes,
higher reuse potential.
