The protected variations pattern protects elements from the variations on other elements
(objects, systems, subsystems) by wrapping the focus of instability with an interface and using polymorphism
to create various implementations of this interface.

Problem: How to design objects, subsystems, and systems so that the variations or instability in these elements
do not have an undesirable impact on other elements?
Solution: Identify points of predicted variation or instability; assign responsibilities to create
a stable interface around them.
