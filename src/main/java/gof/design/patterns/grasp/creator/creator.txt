Creator
See also: Factory pattern
The creation of objects is one of the most common activities in an object-oriented system. Which class is responsible
for creating objects is a fundamental property of the relationship between objects of particular classes.

Problem: Who creates object A?
Solution: In general, Assign class B the responsibility to create object A if one, or preferably more, of the following apply:

Instances of B contain or compositely aggregate instances of A
Instances of B record instances of A
Instances of B closely use instances of A
Instances of B have the initializing information for instances of A and pass it on creation.
